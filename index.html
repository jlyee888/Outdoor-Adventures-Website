          <p>
            Welcome to my outdoor adventures website! I made this website
            because I wanted to create a web tool to help plan hikes and other
            outdoor adventures in my home county and its surrounding area. 
            Under each regional area tab, one can find hike/backpacking planning resources
            to make their next trip a success!
            In the future, I will implement more pages detailing hiking information for
            different national forests and wilderness areas. I will also try to turn part of this
            website into a blog so you can read about my outdoor adventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continue to get better at website making, newer features will
            streamline your hike-planning process so stay tuned! :)

          <h1>A little about me...</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a SoCal native that loves being in the outdoors. As a Boy Scout,
            I backpacked 5 days in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico's Philmont
            Scout Ranch. Since then, I've enjoyed the solitude, challenge, and
            mental comfort of being in the great outdoors.

            18 Jul 2022. My latest hike was in the Santa Monica Mountains where I 
            hiked Sandstone Peak with my friend Saarang. Sandstone Peak is the highest
            mountain in the Santa Monica Mountain Range and the weather that day
            was quite hot. However, the clear skies and deep canyon views made 
            bearing the heat worth it!

            On Aug 28-29, my dad, brother, and I went on a backpacking trip to
            San Jacinto NF. We took South Ridge trail up to Tahquitz Peak and
            it's famous fire-lookout. Read more about it soon (when my blog page featured 
            gets implemented).
