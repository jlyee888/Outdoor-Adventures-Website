# My Outdoor Adventures Website

Currently a static website I created to help me plan hikes and other outdoor adventures in my home city and surrounding area. I also created this website to learn how to write HTML, CSS, and JS code. 

My goals are to develop this site as a personal project and I hope to add in the following features:
* A script that runs in the background that webscrapes the fire restrictions for the National Forests pages I will implement
* A place for me to upload blog posts as a site admin that will get saved on the server and be visible to site viewers
* A script that scrapes my emails for meetup.com hike ideas and uploads them to a list of recommended hikes.
